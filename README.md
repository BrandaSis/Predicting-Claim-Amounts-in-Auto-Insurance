# Predicting-Claim-Amounts-in-Auto-Insurance
This project used 2015 U.S. auto insurance claims and vehicle registration data to predict claim amounts. Regression models were weak, so we reframed the task as high vs. low claims. A Support Vector Machine achieved 57% accuracy, showing limited predictive power but highlighting the need for broader contextual factors.
